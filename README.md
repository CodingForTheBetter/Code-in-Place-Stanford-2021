# Code-in-Place-Stanford-2021
This is a 5-week introductory online Python programming course based on material from the first half of Stanfordâ€™s introductory programming course, CS106A.

CS106A, Stanford's Intro to Computer Science

CS106A is one of the most popular courses at Stanford University, taken by almost 1,600 students every year. It has been developed over the last 30 years by an amazing team, including Nick Parlante, Eric Roberts, and more. The course teaches the fundamentals of computer programming using the widely-used Python programming language. This course is for everyone from humanists, social scientists, to hardcore engineers. Code in Place is built off the first half of CS106A.

## Note:
This github repo is meant to store everything that I did in Code In Place 2021. I have no intention to copy and share the content made by CIP elsewhere. I wish to record my progress  here and also use it as a memeory lane for the future. All credits go to the CIP staff and teachers who made this possible. I am *NOT* the owner of this content. I have only solved the problems created by CIP and put it on this repo.

Thank you CIP!
