Write an algorithm that takes in a square patch like this photo of Simba the Dog:

  <img width="200" src="https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/jYLDZH9EZB9EwUxuuqys7OxJ" alt="Material Bread logo">
</p>

And creates an image which has the patch copied 6 times (in 2 rows and 3 columns) where each patch gets re-colored. This effect is inspired by some of Andy Warhol’s paintings.

We strongly recommend implementing a function, like so:

`def make_recolored_patch(red_scale, green_scale, blue_scale):`

Which returns a new colored patch. See the starter code for details.

Don’t try to match the colors in this example exactly. Experiment with different combinations of red_scale, green_scale and blue_scale. The pink Simba was generated by:

`make_recolored_patch(1.5, 0, 1.5)`

Define other functions too! How about a function which adds a colored patch to the final_image at a given row, column?
